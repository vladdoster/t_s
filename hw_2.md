# Part 1

1. My two data sets are Soy Bean sales data from 1975-2005 and Max Daily Temperatures in New Zealand. The soy beans dataset came from the US government and the New Zealand dataset came from https://niwa.co.nz/.

3. The linear model for the trend is y = 11.64x + 95.14. The error is fairly normal which makes us comfortable with accepting the model. It is neither under/over fit.

4. The seasonal model will be y = cos(2piT). The error seems to be normally distributed which means that this dataset is statonary and possibly iid.

5. Forecasts:

The linear model for the trend data predicts a value to be between 396.212 and 463.6172 which is reasonable. 

The model for the seasonal data predicts a value to between 10.92 and 12.012.


# Part 2

a. The data is very much cyclic however there seems to be an upward trend in sales of beer which plataeus and seems to be pulling back.

b. The data shows that there are greater sales in the warmer months and less sales in the colder months which makes sense given activity goes up during the summer.

c. The line output would be y=0.1654 -302.7121. This shows a very small trend over time which makes sense because there are always more people becoming adults.

d.

e. The quadratic time model would be y = -.01840x^2 + 7.315x â€“ 0.0007267.
